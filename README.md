# Bevy Template

Template to quickly spin up a project without needing to write out a lot of boilerplate.

## Important Notes
- The renderer uses `default_nearest` by default.

## Features
- Input management using [leafwing](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing-input-manager)
- /bin/game.rs for the main function to allow for easy other builds (level editor, etc)
